# To-Do List App

## 📖 Overview

The **To-Do List App** is my **first formal mini-project** and also the **first time using GitHub and Git**. While building this project, I’ve relied on AI guidance to learn and improve. This app is designed to help manage daily tasks efficiently and serves as a starting point in my journey to become a Full-Stack Java Developer.

## 🚀 Features

1. **Add Tasks**: Users can input tasks and add them to the list.
2. **Mark as Complete**: Tasks can be marked as completed for better organization.
3. **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
4. **LocalStorage**: The app saves tasks locally, so they persist even after a page refresh.
5. **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and clean design for ease of use.

## 💡 How It Works

1. Users enter a task into the input field and click the "Add Task" button.
2. The task is displayed in a list below the input field.
3. Tasks can be marked as completed with a single click.
4. Users can delete tasks individually.
5. All tasks are stored in `localStorage`, ensuring data is saved between sessions.
